# BBM Enterprise SDK iOS Data Transfer Sample

This directory contains sample code for a Data Transfer application 
that demonstrates how to use the peer-to-peer data connection capability of
the BBM Enterprise SDK. This example builds on the [Quick Start Swift](../QuickStartSwift/README.md) example that
demonstrates how you can authenticate with the 
BBM Enterprise SDK using the [Identity Provider](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/identityManagement.html) 
of your application.
