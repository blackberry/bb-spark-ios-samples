# Quick Start for iOS

The Quick Start example application demonstrates how you can authenticate
with BlackBerry Spark Communications Services with user authentication disabled
while using the BlackBerry Key Management Service. This example is implemented
in Objective-C; for the Swift implementation, see the
[Quick Start Swift](../QuickStartSwift/README.md) example.

## Getting Started

This example requires the Spark Communications SDK, which you can find along with related resources at the location below.

### Configuration

By default, this example application is configured to work in a domain with user
authentication disabled and the BlackBerry Key Management Service enabled.
See the [Download & Configure](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/gettingStarted.html)
section of the Developer Guide to get started configuring a
[domain](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/faq.html#domain)
in the [sandbox](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/faq.html#sandbox).

Once you have a domain in the sandbox, edit Quick Start's `ConfigSettings.plist` file
to configure the example with your domain ID.

```
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>authProvider</key>
	<string>testAuth</string>
	<key>useBlackBerryKMS</key>
	<true/>
	<key>testAuth</key>
	<dict>
		<key>clientId</key>
		<string>not_used</string>
		<key>domain</key>
		<string>UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN</string>
		<key>environment</key>
		<string>sandbox</string>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

When you run Quick Start, it will prompt you for a user ID and a password. Since
you've configured your domain to have user authentication disabled, you can
enter any string you like for the user ID and an SDK identity will be created
for it. Other applications that you run in the same domain will be able to find
this identity by this user ID. The password is used to protected the keys stored
in the
[BlackBerry Key Management Service](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/security.html).

- [Observable Montior](#observableMonitor)
- [BBM Token Manager](#bbmTokenManager)

### <a name="supportLibrary"></a>Support Library

Common code for authenticating users, synchronizing keys and performing common tasks can be found in `examples/Support/Source`.  Much of the heavy lifting can be found in these classes and they should be referenced before implementing a custom key management or authentication scheme.

`BBMAuthController` and `BBMKeyManager` can be instantiated with classes/instances that allow you to substitute your own user authentication or key management scheme while handling all of the SDK related functionality.

`BBMAccess` provides wrappers around common outgoing messages and the SDK data model.

You may use, extend, or modify this code as needed for your own application.


### <a name="accountController"></a>AccountViewController

`AccountViewController` is the primary entry point for the application.

To observe connectivity changes to the BBM Enterprise Service we first add our instance as a connectivity listener to the service:
```objective-c
[[BBMEnterpriseService service] addConnectivityListener:self];
```
And implement the delegate method to update the UI when connectivity changes:
```objective-c
- (void)connectivityStateChange:(BOOL)connected strict:(BOOL)connectedStrict
{
    self.platformConnectivityLabel.text = connected ? @"Connected" : @"Disconnected";
}
```

We then create an instance of a `BBMAuthController`, set ourselves as the rootController (which provides a UI context for pushing auth related modal UI) and add ourselves as a delegate:
```objective-c
Class tokenManager = [BBMGoogleTokenManager class];
//Alternatively: Class tokenManager = [BBMAzureTokenManager class];

self.authController = [[BBMAuthController alloc] initWithTokenManager:tokenManager
                                                           userSource:nil
                                                   keyStorageProvider:nil
                                                               domain:[BBMConfigManager defaultManager].sdkServiceDomain
                                                          environment:[BBMConfigManager defaultManager].environment];

self.authController.rootController = self;

//Auth controller using delegation
[self.authController addDelegate:self];
```

Once we have an `authController` instance we can use it to start the service and and sign in if we have cached credentials:
```objective-c
//Start the service.
[self.authController startBBMEnterpriseService];

//Resume our previous session
[self.authController signInSilently];
```

`BBMAuthControllerDelegate` calls back via two delegate methods where we update the user interface to show the auth state.  You may also use an `ObservableMonitor` from anywhere in you code to monitor the credentials and service state.  See the [Simple Chat](../SimpleChat/README.html) for a more detailed example on how to use `ObservableMonitor`s to monitor credential changes.

```objective-c
//The AuthController will invoke this callback any time the user credentials/auth state changes
- (void)authStateChanged:(BBMAuthState *)authState
{
    //Update our UI
}

- (void)serviceStateChanged:(BOOL)serviceStarted
{
    //Update our UI
}
```

### <a name="bbmAuthController"></a>BBMAuthController

`BBMAuthController` handles the details of starting the BBM Enterprise service and retrieving and setting user tokens.

The actual fetching of the tokens is handled by an `id<BBMTokenManager>` class.   You may substitue any class that implements the `BBMTokenManager` protocol in `initWithTokenManager:` if you wish to use a different oAuth provider.

To start the service call:
```objective-c
[[BBMEnterpriseService service] start:SDK_SERVICE_DOMAIN environment:SDK_ENVIROMENT completionBlock:^(BOOL success) {
    self.serviceStarted = success;
    //Inform our delegates (AccountViewController) that the service state has changed
}];
```

The primary purpose of `BBMAuthController` is to respond to delegate callbacks from the `BBMTokenManager` instance.  These happen via two delegate callbacks defined in `BBMAuthenticationDelegate.h` and in turn update the UI via the `BBMAuthControllerDelegate` methods and/or via monitored changes to the observable authState and serviceState properties:
```objective-c
- (void)localAuthDataChanged:(BBMAuthenticatedAccount *)accountData error:(NSError *)error
{
    //Handle changes in the auth state.  This method will be called whenever the authenticated
    //account information changes.
    if(error) {
        NSLog(@"Sign in error %@", error.localizedDescription);
    }

    //No account data means we have logged out.
    if(nil == accountData) {
        BBMAuthState *authState = [BBMAuthState emptyAuthState];
        //This property is observable so changing it here will trigger any ObservableMonitors that dereference it.
        self.authState = authState;
        for(id<BBMAuthControllerDelegate> delegate in self.delegates) {
            if([delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(authStateChanged:)]) {
                [delegate authStateChanged:self.authState];
            }
        }
        return;
    }

    SetupStateBlock callback = ^(NSString *authTokenState, NSString *setupState, NSNumber *regId) {
        BBMAuthState *authState = [[BBMAuthState alloc] init];
        authState.account = accountData;
        authState.authTokenState = authTokenState;
        authState.setupState = setupState;
        authState.regId = regId;
        self.authState = authState;
        for(id<BBMAuthControllerDelegate> delegate in self.delegates) {
            if([delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(authStateChanged:)]) {
                [delegate authStateChanged:self.authState];
            }
        }
    };

    [[BBMEnterpriseService service] sendAuthToken:accountData.accessToken
                                      forUserName:accountData.accountId
                                  setupStateBlock:callback];
}

- (UIViewController *)authController
{
    //Provide the id<BBMTokenManager> with a root controller for presenting a modal sign in window.
    return self.rootController;
}
```

The critical part here is updating the service authentication tokens.  This is done via:
```objective-c
[[BBMEnterpriseService service] sendAuthToken:accountData.accessToken
                                  forUserName:accountData.accountId
                              setupStateBlock:callback];
```
The callback will be invoked multiple times as the `setupState` and authState of the user changes with some states such as `DeviceSwitchRequired` requiring user interaction.

#### <a name="observableMonitor"></a>Note on ObservableMontitor

To make a property on a class observable via an `ObservableMonitor` you must call `ObservableTracker` `getterCalledForObject:propertyName:` from the property getter.  Usage of `ObservableMonitors` 
is entirely optional, but is implemented for all properties on SDK model objects and can be leveraged in your code in lieu of directly using KVO.  See [Rich Chat](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/html/examples/ios/RichChat/README.html) or [Simple Chat](../SimpleChat/README.md) for examples.  `ObservableMonitors` and observable properties are not thread safe.  See the [ObservableMonitor](https://developer.blackberry.com/files/bbm-enterprise/documents/guide/reference/ios/interface_observable_monitor.html) documentation for additional details.
```objective-c
- (BBMAuthState *)authState
{
    //propertyName must match the actual property name.
    [ObservableTracker getterCalledForObject:self propertyName:@"authState"];
    return _authState;
}
```

### <a name="bbmTokenManager"></a>BBMTokenManager

`localAuthDataChanged:account:error` is called from a `BBMTokenManager` instance when the credentials change.  This is implemented in `BBMGoogleTokenManager` for the GoogleSignIn API as follows:
```objective-c
- (void)googleSignInStateChanged:(NSError *)error
{
    GIDGoogleUser *user = [GIDSignIn sharedInstance].currentUser;

    if(nil == user) {
        [self.delegate localAuthDataChanged:nil error:error];
        return;
    }

    //name, email and avatarURL are optional.  userID is implementation dependent.
    BBMAuthenticatedAccount *accountData = [BBMAuthenticatedAccount accountDataWithId:user.userID
                                                                                idToken:user.authentication.idToken
                                                                          accessToken:user.authentication.accessToken
                                                                                 name:user.profile.name
                                                                                email:user.profile.email
                                                                            avatarURL:[user.profile imageURLWithDimension:120]];

    [self.delegate localAuthDataChanged:accountData error:error];
}
```
